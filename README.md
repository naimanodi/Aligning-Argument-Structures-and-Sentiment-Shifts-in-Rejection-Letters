# Aligning-Argument-Structures-and-Sentiment-Shifts-in-Rejection-Letters: A Study of Conflicting Communication Dynamics

In this project, we aim to analyze the relationship between argument structures and shifts in sentiment within rejection letters or emails. We hypothesize that, despite the negative intent of these communications (i.e., rejection), they often contain a significant amount of positive language—particularly in the form of positive adjectives or feedback. This creates a paradox, as the positive sentiment contrasts with the ultimate negative conclusion. We propose that the conflicting or supporting relationships between different sections of the letter may correspond to these shifts in sentiment. For example, positive feedback on a candidate’s qualifications might form a supporting relationship, while the final rejection introduces a conflict.

To investigate this, we will implement argument mining sub-tasks, such as segmentation and relation classification, to identify and classify these argumentative structures. Sentiment analysis will also be applied to track how sentiment changes throughout the letter. By comparing the outputs of both argument and sentiment analyses, we aim to uncover how argument structure and sentiment shifts align in the context of rejection letters. This project bridges argument mining and sentiment analysis, providing a deeper understanding of how professional communication balances politeness with clarity when delivering negative news.

# Approach

In this study, we utilize the Job-Rejection-Analysis dataset to conduct an exploratory data analysis of job rejection emails. The dataset included formal texts consistent of multiple sentences and typically expressed polite introductions, rejections and encouragements. The objective was to classify transitions between argumentative segments for the purposes of later chunking or pattern derivation. The preprocessing of this data involves cleaning the content with BeautifulSoup from the bs4 library to remove any HTML tags or irrelevant information. Subsequently, we segment the cleaned text using full stops as indicators of sentence boundaries, facilitated by the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). This segmentation allows for an analysis of individual sentences, which we then subject to sentiment analysis to label the emotional tone conveyed in each rejection. By identifying the relationships between argumentative segments of these emails, we aim to derive insights into how organizations communicate unfavorable decisions by providing structured relation classification.

While browsing the dataset, we noticed a consistent pattern: no rejection letter begins with the rejection itself. Instead, the emails typically start with expressions of gratitude for the application or other positive sentiments. This observation leads us to hypothesize that a sentiment change from positive to negative will indicate the point at which the "conclusion" of the letter, specifically the rejection, is presented (see (1)). This hypothesis suggests that the initial positive framing serves to soften the impact of the subsequent negative news.

(1) Sentiment Change; Positive → Negative: This scenario highlights the transition from a positive sentiment at the beginning of the letter to a negative sentiment when the rejection is communicated. We hypothesize that this shift signifies the conclusion of the email, marking the moment when the unfavorable decision is presented.

In addition to this primary hypothesis, we identified other potential relationships that may emerge from the sentiment analysis:

(2) No Sentiment Change; Positive → Positive: This scenario indicates a supportive tone throughout the email, potentially reinforcing the candidate's worth despite the unfavorable outcome. Such letters may include phrases that highlight the candidate's strengths or encourage future applications.

(3) No Sentiment Change; Negative → Negative: In this case, the letter maintains a negative sentiment, which can be interpreted as a justification for the rejection. This consistency may manifest through language that emphasizes the competitiveness of the selection process or explicitly outlines the reasons for the decision.

(4) Sentiment Change; Negative → Positive: This relationship suggests a shift towards encouragement, where the letter may conclude with positive remarks aimed at motivating the candidate to pursue future opportunities or to recognize their potential. This type of communication could play a crucial role in mitigating the emotional impact of the rejection.

We observed that most rejection letters followed a consistent structure: a polite introduction with positive sentiment, followed by a negative rejection statement, and often concluding with positive encouragement for future applications. By systematically analyzing these sentiment transitions within the rejection letters, we were able to uncover deeper insights into how organizations use the structure of formal rejections communications. In the future, our approach could be enhanced by use of the trained ML models that would consider more contextual features.
